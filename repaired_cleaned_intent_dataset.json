    "answer": "Artificial intelligence (AI) content generation tools cover a range of skills e.g., writing, art / design, computer coding. They generate content based on questions that the user inputs to the tool. AI writing tools work by simulating natural conversation and writing content by predicting the next word in a sequence based on their immense database. They can develop well-structured paragraphs or papers based on this method. These tools continue to learn from user responses and other available data e.g. from the internet. AI visual content generation tools such as OpenArt, Dalle-2, Hugging Face, work in a similar way but based on image/shape recognition combined with natural language processing. Before using any free tool you should read the terms and conditions carefully. It is rare for a tool or app to be completely free. Most tools / apps that are free make money in other ways e.g. advertising, taking your personal data and using or selling it. Think carefully and critically about the risks, benefits and ethics before you make use of any technology, including AI content generation tools. Please read the following FAQ section carefully to understand what it means for you as a student to use these tools, particularly around the context of assessments and exams."

For example, you might use them: As a starting point for research in the same way that you might use a search engine (although bear in mind that, as with other information found on the internet, the answers provided by the AI tool may be untrue), To develop your questions about a topic, refining your questions to focus more on the topic and developing your critical thinking in the process. If you choose to use such a tool: Remember to check that you are comfortable with the terms and conditions before you do so (e.g., are you happy that your personal data might be shared or sold to others?). Be aware that the tool may give you answers which are incorrect, illogical and / or biased. You will need to use other sources and your own understanding of a topic to confirm the accuracy of any information provided. Follow the correct citation and referencing for your school to acknowledge non-AI sources of information which you use in your submission. Ensure that you clearly identify any work in an assessment which is not your own work e.g. if you ask questions of an AI tool and use the answers, then this would not be wholly your own work and should be identified and acknowledged appropriately. Seek advice from your module leader on how this should be done for your assessment. Be prepared to provide a copy of your AI conversation as an appendix."

    "answer": "We provide students with engaging, real-world learning opportunities to equip you for lives and careers in a global digital world. There is no doubt that artificial intelligence and large language models, accessed through platforms such as ChatGPT, will be a part of the future workplace. This is why we encourage you to think critically about the implications of digital tools for your studies, your current learning and your future lives. We also recognise the potential for these tools to empower you in your own learning and, when used responsibly, make learning more inclusive and accessible. We aim to provide every student with the support to engage with a range of learning opportunities during your studies, thereby reducing the likelihood of any student choosing to miss out on the learning involved in creating your own work for assessments and instead submitting the output of an AI platform. We are actively engaged in gathering students' opinions on ChatGPT and this will be informing our engagement with this topic going forward. We are reviewing the developments in AI content generation tools and will continue to explore how best to use these tools positively, ethically and safely for learning and teaching.

    "question": "How can postgraduates ethically use Generative AI in research?",
    "answer": "With the rapid advancement of AI technology, tools such as Chat-GPT are now widely available and will continue to develop quickly, as will our societal and legal responses to the technology. The below guidance is based on current, available technology. Many of the points below are prompts to think, not hard and fast rules. Postgraduate research at the University is founded on three golden pillars: independence, originality and significance. When using Generative AI (Gen AI) tools, consider: Can Gen AI produced text ever be considered original? If an algorithm is producing the text, in what sense could you claim to have produced it independently? And if the work is not original, how does it contribute significantly to knowledge? Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, work by analysing material to predict and generate content based on prompts. They do not create new ideas, but rely on patterns in pre-existing data. Therefore their limitations are: These tools are not designed to generate genuinely new ideas As postgraduate research requires the development of new ideas, the use of generative AI models as tools for this purpose is limited. The current UK laws governing copyright do not fully address Generative AI, which creates legal uncertainty. As generative AI models (such as GPTs) often rely on copyrighted works: Outputs from Generative AI will constitute plagiarism, even where it is not directly copied. Use of such content in your thesis may constitute plagiarism. All of our research postgraduate degrees (excluding MRes) are examined by viva voce. Significant use of generative AI produced text runs the risk of entering an examination without a solid understanding of the material in your own thesis. This could lead to a fail, whether or not plagiarism can be demonstrated. Generative AI tools can support research for gathering information and brainstorming, and while the results may look different to those produced by conventional search engines, they are no more \u2018intelligent\u2019, original or accurate. Despite the term \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019, these technologies are not capable of thought in the sense that we expect it to be demonstrated in your work. Put simply: While generative AI models may be able to help you find potentially relevant information, provide a prompt for thought or guidance, They cannot do the work of critical thinking for you. All RPG students are expected to meet regularly with their supervisors and: Share their writing throughout their studies. Discuss any intended use of generative AI with supervisors early So your supervisors can provide advice and guidance. If you choose to use Generative AI tools to assist in any stage of your research, you must follow the below guidance. Appropriately cite any text or output generated by AI in your thesis, as you would any other sources. Clearly indicate where in AI-generated material is included your thesis. Options include a narrative account in your introduction or a detailed appendix. Generative AI tools have limitations; always use them in conjunction with other sources to ensure the credibility and reliability of the information you present. Ensure the final product is your own work, and not copied from an Generative AI tool, like Chat GPT. You may use generated text as a prompt for inspiration or guidance, but the final submitted assessment must be your work, your creation, and your own analysis. In addition to the optional inclusion of a reflective narrative of the use of AI as suggested above, all students are required to make a declaration of their use of generative AI in their thesis, including in the course of the research reported in the thesis. Have you utilised any generative AI tools in your thesis, including the research which forms the basis of your thesis? YES / NO If yes, please provide a brief account of your use of such generative AI tools."

    "answer": "All online exams will be available via the exam server. The exam server will open for you to check your access the week before the start date of exams - you'll receive an email advising you to check.\n\nThe exam server will be open for the designated duration of the exam. This includes 50% additional time to provide an inclusive approach to ensure that the requirements of those students who need additional exam time are already accommodated. It is also intended to allow sufficient time for all students to upload materials and as mitigation for any temporary network problems during the exam.\n\nThe time shown on your personalised exam timetable is the correct full duration and already includes any additional time - no additional time is given on top of this.\n\nThis should ensure all students have sufficient time to:\n- Complete your exam answer\n- Download/upload materials required\n- Mitigate against any temporary network issues/disturbances\n- Ensure students with individual learning profiles are not disadvantaged\n\nSome exam papers will set an indicative word count to give you additional guidance on the length of answers that you should be aiming to submit. In all exams you should read the instructions carefully and ensure you understand what is being asked before you start to answer questions.\n\nPlease allow yourself plenty of time to deal with any technical interface issues - the extended time should be used primarily by you to manage such matters if required, so you should aim to be working on your answers for designated duration of the exam as noted on the front cover of your exam question paper. No additional time can be added, and late submissions cannot be accepted.\n\nFor more information, view the online video guide for student exams."

If you don\u2019t, this will likely prevent you from being successful in using the arrangements in place to support your studies.\n\nPlease do not wait until you have your assessment results to tell us about something that has impacted you, as it will be too late by then.\n\nThis guidance explains a range of processes we have in place to support you:\n- Extensions\n- Deferrals\n- Retrospective Extenuating Circumstances\n- Exceptional Extenuating Circumstances\n\nPlease be aware that some of these options mean you will be 'voiding' an assessment attempt, which means a zero mark just now and an opportunity to sit the assessment again."

Some exam papers will set an indicative word count to give you additional guidance on the length of answers that you should be aiming to submit. In all exams you should read the instructions carefully and ensure you understand what is being asked before you start to answer questions. Please allow yourself plenty of time to deal with any technical interface issues - the extended time should be used primarily by you to manage such matters if required, so you should aim to be working on your answers for designated duration of the exam as noted on the front cover of your exam question paper.

Students must complete the exam script books in ink, unless otherwise stated.\n\nIf you finish more than fifteen minutes before the end of the exam, raise your hand to attract the attention of the invigilator who will come to you to collect your script books. Students finishing within fifteen minutes of the end of the exam will not be allowed to leave the room until the end of the exam.\n\nAt the end of the exam, remain in your seat until the invigilator has collected your script books from you. Script books will be anonymously marked. Please ensure that your Registration Number appears on EACH script book and that you have followed the instruction on the cover of the script book.\n\nIf you become ill during an exam to such an extent that you are unable to continue with the exam, you must draw this to the attention of an invigilator immediately for further advice. If you feel that your performance is affected during this exam by factors beyond your control, e.g. external noise or other factors, please inform your invigilator and after the exam is complete contact your school office within two working days for further advice.\n\nAny action contrary to these instructions may lead to disciplinary action being taken by the University."

Acceptable file formats are Microsoft Word (doc, docx), PDF, OpenOffice (odt). Apple Pages are not acceptable and you should export these as a PDF before uploading to the Exam Server. One Drive is also not acceptable as this format cannot be opened and will not be accepted.\n\nThis student video shows how you can upload and submit your exam answer documents.

    "answer": "If you have decided to leave the university, your course and therefore your student accommodation, please refer to Section 25 of the Tenancy Agreement:\n\n- It is the student's responsibility to ensure a tutor written (email) confirmation has been received by their Accommodation Officer (details on the kitchen noticeboard) stating the fact the student has left their Course/University.\n- It is the student's responsibility to ensure the 'request to terminate tenancy' document is completed and returned to their Accommodation Officer\n\nOnly once both essential requirements have been met will your Accommodation Officer approve your Early Termination request due to Leaving University. At this point your 28-day notice period will start, during which time your recurring card payment will remain active and rental payments will be deducted. You will be charged a \u00a350 early termination fee. Only once the notice period has been complete will our finance team cancel your recurring card payment and arrange a refund if applicable. This can take 3-5 days to be processed."

They will then reach out to the replacement student to allow them to accept the offer and complete the application process. Only once this has been completed can we agree with the current and potential replacement student a transfer tenancy date. The current student will only be released from the liability of their tenancy agreement once the replacement student has moved into the student accommodation for a 4-hour duration. If the replacement student changes their mind during any part of this process the liability will remain with the current student.\n\nPlease note students will not be released from tenancy agreement for any reasons not stated above. However, if the student has extenuating circumstances we would recommend they contact their Accommodation Officer to discuss the situation."

Once you've registered, you'll be able to book an SST appointment via MyFuture. You can choose whether your appointment is face to face, online, or over the phone."
